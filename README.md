### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository implements two object detection algorithms based on SIFT 

### Requirements ###

* Python 3
* Numpy
* OpenCV 



### Overview ###
 * A project about object detection techniques based on computer vision.
 * The algorithm can be deployed to identify query images contained inside a scene, the provided example shows an use case of product recognition on store shelves.
 * In order to work properly, the algorithm needs two inputs:
 * A scene image, containing the query(ies) to be found.
 * A query image, the image to be recognised.
